    "SQL databases are relational databases that store data in structured tables with predefined schemas. Each table has columns (attributes) and rows (records).\n",
    "They are also known as RDBMS (Relational Database Management Systems) and include popular systems like MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, and Microsoft SQL Server.\n",
    "SQL databases use a fixed schema, meaning the structure of the database, including table names, column names, and data types, is defined before data insertion.\n",
    "Data integrity is enforced through relationships and constraints defined in the schema.\n",
    "SQL databases are best suited for structured data with well-defined relationships, and they are excellent for complex queries and transactions.\n",
    "They are typically used in scenarios where data consistency and ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) transactions are critical.\n",
    "\n",
    "NoSQL (Not Only SQL) Databases:\n",
    "\n",
    "NoSQL databases are non-relational databases designed to store and manage unstructured or semi-structured data. They include document stores, key-value stores, column-family stores, and graph databases.\n",
    "Examples of NoSQL databases include MongoDB (document store), Cassandra (column-family store), Redis (key-value store), and Neo4j (graph database).\n",
    "NoSQL databases provide flexibility in data modeling, allowing developers to store data in a more dynamic and schema-less manner.\n",
    "They are suitable for handling large volumes of data, including data that doesn't fit neatly into structured tables, such as JSON or XML documents.\n",
    "NoSQL databases are often used in scenarios that require horizontal scalability and high availability, like web applications and big data analytics.\n",
    "Unlike SQL databases, they may sacrifice some aspects of data consistency (e.g., eventual consistency) for scalability and performance."
